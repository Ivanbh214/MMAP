# this program reads the prepped.fasta file produced by PIPITS
# then it  creates as many files as diferent characters are in the
# first two positions of the sequnece id
#
# in the example there were the libraries A B C --- L
# if more than one character is used to differentiate the individual libraries,
# then the program has to be changed accordingly
